The analytics .zip file contains:
* all analytics code and dependencies in lib
* a wrapper.conf file that is used to configure the jvm/logging
* a bin directory for running the service through the Tanuki Java Service Wrapper. 

To run analytics, ensure that all files in bin/ have execute permissions and run `bin/nodeable-analytics start|stop|restart|console`.
